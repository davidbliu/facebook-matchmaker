Mitchell Quon said: Public Health 116 is a 2 unit seminar on social, political, and ethical issues in health and medicine. It covers topics such as nutrition, bioengineering, epidemiology, mental and sexual health, and health care policy and economics with different speakers every week. It's a fascinating class that covers many different breadths and is fairly easy (taken on a Pass/No Pass basis). 

There is an optional 1 unit discussion section that goes along with the lecture called Public Health 98 (or Public Health 198 for juniors and seniors) that allows you to discuss the lecture and even do practice problems that may possibly be on the midterms (*hint hint). I will be one of the TAs for these discussion sections. 

If you are taking the class, my discussion section will be on Friday from 9:00-10:00 AM. Room is TBD. Thank you!: 1

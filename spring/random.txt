Kevin Zhang said: So I've made a couple of calls and done some research, I think the best deal (and one where I can get a reservation) will be on Sunday May 3rd at US Paintball Nation(where we went last year). It will probably be around $30-40$ per person which covers all-day admission + 500 paintballs + unlimited air + mask + gun. It will be about a 2 hour drive. I'll put up a form tomorrow/tonight to get people to confirm their spots. I'm going to ask people to make a deposit of $40 to me if they want to go so that I can hold people accountable of showing up to cover no-show fees, I'll refund any difference afterwords!: 4
